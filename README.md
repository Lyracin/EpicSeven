# EpicSeven Morale Calculator
Program written in java

This is a program to calculate the maximum morale combinations based on the selected characters. 
Input your choices into Choices.txt, 1 hero per line, no spaces in between words, and caps per word. For example, Church of Ilryos Axe would be ChurchOfIlryosAxe. If no choices are entered, all heroes will be selected.
The output will be sent to Best Combinations.txt

There is also options to force include heroes. By entering heroes in the same format to Include.txt, the generator will ensure that at least one of those entered heroes is included in every outputed team. Include2.txt is an extension of this and will only work if Include.txt has information. Similarly, it will force at least one of the heroes in on each team, separate from the list in Include.txt.
